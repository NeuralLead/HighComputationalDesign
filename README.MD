<h1>High Computational Design</h1>
</br>
</center>

**HighComputationalDesign** is an open-source graphical software written in **C#** and **Avalonia**, designed for the **creation and simulation of digital circuit designs** with 2-state (bit) or 3-state (tribit) logic.  
The main goal is to enable the definition of digital logic **using high-level programming languages** such as **C#** and, soon, **Python**, avoiding the complexity of traditional hardware languages like **Verilog** and **VHDL**.

## üß† Project Philosophy

The idea behind HighComputationalDesign is to **make hardware design more accessible**, allowing developers to work with familiar tools like C# or Python.  
The aim is to **automate low-level synthesis and simulation processes**, down to the generation of transistor-level circuits, also thanks to the integration of **artificial intelligence techniques**.

---

## üîç Main Features

- üß© **Interactive graphical design** of 2-bit and 3-bit digital circuits.  
- üíª **Logic definition via C# scripts** (and Python in future versions).  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Accurate simulation with [SpiceSharp](https://github.com/SpiceSharp/SpiceSharp) backend** (SPICE-based).  
- üß± **Entity Model System (EMS) architecture** to separate and manage the processor‚Äôs internal logic.  
- üìö Integrated library of **logic components and memory systems** for debugging and testing.  
- ü§ñ Automation of hardware synthesis processes down to the lowest level of abstraction (transistor).  
- üåç **Cross-platform compatibility**: Windows, Linux, macOS (thanks to .NET 8 and Avalonia).

## ‚ú® Example: High-Level Counter/Accumulator Script

One of the strengths of **HighComputationalDesign** is the ability to define component logic using C# scripts.  
Below is an example of a **counter** that increments its value every time the input transitions from LOW to HIGH, exposing the value on the first 4 output pins (in binary format):

```csharp
// File Created with HighComputationalDesign in 2025

using CustomComponents;

static class ScriptState
{
    static bool latestState = false;
    static byte counter = 0;

    public static void OnUpdate(ThresholdBiasingBehavior Self)
    {
        bool v = Self.GetInputPin(0);
        if (latestState != v)
        {
            latestState = v;
            if(v)
                counter++;
        }

        var bits = IntToBits(counter, 4);
        
        Self.SetOutputPin(0, bits[0]);
        Self.SetOutputPin(1, bits[1]);
        Self.SetOutputPin(2, bits[2]);
        Self.SetOutputPin(3, bits[3]);
    }
}
```

**What does this script do?**
- Counts the number of rising edges (from 0 to 1) on input pin 0.
- Converts the counter value to 4 bits.
- Outputs each bit on output pins 0‚Äì3.

> **Note:** With this approach, you can create complex digital components using C# logic, without writing low-level code!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The software adopts an **Entity Model System** architecture, which allows you to:
- Separate the various internal logics (CPU, memory, bus, ALU, etc.);
- Easily extend and modify any part of the system;
- Integrate new types of components or custom modules.
